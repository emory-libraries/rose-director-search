                        <p>Consisting of an astonishing 75,000-volume collection of rare and first editions of modern and contemporary poetry, the <a href="https://scholarblogs.emory.edu/danowskipoetrylibrary/">Raymond Danowski Poetry Library</a> was assembled by collector Raymond Danowski over 25 years.

                        <ul>

                        <p><a href="http://rose.library.emory.edu/collections/african-american-history-culture/index.html">African American collections</a> in the Rose Library embrace political and social movements, literature and the arts, and sports. They document expatriate performers Josephine Baker and Bricktop, baseball great Hank Aaron, civil rights leader C. T. Vivian, historian Carter G. Woodson, Harlem Renaissance writer Langston Hughes, and dozens of others. Significant holdings include the <a href="https://findingaids.library.emory.edu/documents/sclc1083/">Southern Christian Leadership Conference</a> records and the <a href="https://findingaids.library.emory.edu/documents/langmuir1218/">Robert Langmuir African American Photograph Collection</a>. The printed materials, photographs, correspondence, and ephemera include a 1773 signed first edition of Phillis Wheatley&rsquo;s book of poems. This collection also maintains the personal libraries of artists/scholars/ filmmakers Camille Billops and James V. Hatch.</p>
                        <p>The library focuses on six principal collecting areas:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Civil rights and post-civil rights movements</li>
                            <li>Black print culture </li>
                            <li>African American literature and the arts</li>
                            <li>Expatriate literary and cultural figures</li>
                            <li>Religion</li>
                            <li>African Americans and sports</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Such collections make Emory&rsquo;s holdings distinctive and attractive to scholars and students seeking rare and unique materials. From the many gifts of the Camille Billops-James V. Hatch archive to the papers of Charles and Ruth Wood, African American collections are a growing, popular, innovative, and vital pillar in the Rose Library.</p>

Together the materials tell the story of the region&rsquo;s move from the margins to the forefront of American life.</p>

                    <p>Last year the Rose Library showcased materials in 20 campus exhibitions and loaned materials for 11 exhibits at other institutions nationwide, including The Coca-Cola Company and the Brooklyn Museum. Programming for the Rose Library&rsquo;s recent exhibition, &ldquo;<a href="http://billops-hatch.library.emory.edu/">Still Raising Hell</a>,&rdquo; took place on and off campus to encourage new visitors and more dynamic engagement.</p>
                    <p>The Rose Library hosts a full roster of speakers, author readings and other public programs. Highlights including appearances by poet laureates Rita Dove, Juan Felipe Herrera and Natasha Trethewey, Nobel Prize-winner Seamus Heaney, noted novelists Salman Rushdie and Alice Walker, and former President Jimmy Carter.</p>
                    <p>Partnerships across the Emory campus and broader community have enabled the Rose Library to further extend its reach and connect with even broader audiences. A recent campus initiative with Emory&rsquo;s Carlos Museum resulted in a collaborative exhibition of one of Shakespeare&rsquo;s First Folios. Other notable collaborators include the AJC Decatur Book Festival, which has brought keynote speakers such as Civil Rights legend John Lewis and novelist Joyce Carol Oates to the Emory campus.</p>
