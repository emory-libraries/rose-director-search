                            <h4>Raymond Danowski Poetry Library</h4>
                            <p>Consisting of an astonishing 75,000-volume collection of rare and first editions of modern and contemporary poetry, the <a href="https://scholarblogs.emory.edu/danowskipoetrylibrary/">Raymond Danowski Poetry Library</a> was assembled by collector Raymond Danowski over 25 years. The collection is thought to have been the largest poetry library in private hands until its arrival at Emory in 2004. The numerous rare books, chapbooks, little magazines, journals, broadsides, audio recordings, manuscripts, ephemera, and visual art in the collection come from the United States, Britain, Ireland, Australia, India, Canada, Scotland, and South Africa. Remarkable for its range and depth, the library represents Raymond Danowski&rsquo;s desire to gather every book of poetry published in English.</p>
                            <p>Highlights of the collection include:</p>
                            <ul>

                                <li>First edition of T. S. Eliot&rsquo;s Prufrock and Other Observations (1917), inscribed to his close friend Emily Hale </li>
                                <li>Limited editions by Langston Hughes, with corrections in his own hand </li>
                                <li>Anne Sexton&rsquo;s personal, heavily annotated copy of Sylvia Plath&rsquo;s Ariel (1965) </li>
                                <li>Individual author collections, notable for their breadth and depth, including W. H. Auden, Gwendolyn Brooks, Charles Bukowski, Allen Ginsberg, and William Carlos Williams </li>
                            </ul>

                            <h4>African American History and Culture</h4>
                            <p><a href="http://rose.library.emory.edu/collections/african-american-history-culture/index.html">African American collections</a> in the Rose Library embrace political and social movements, literature and the arts, and sports. They document expatriate performers Josephine Baker and Bricktop, baseball great Hank Aaron, civil rights leader C. T. Vivian, historian Carter G. Woodson, Harlem Renaissance writer Langston Hughes, and dozens of others. Significant holdings include the <a href="https://findingaids.library.emory.edu/documents/sclc1083/">Southern Christian Leadership Conference</a> records and the <a href="https://findingaids.library.emory.edu/documents/langmuir1218/">Robert Langmuir African American Photograph Collection</a>. The printed materials, photographs, correspondence, and ephemera include a 1773 signed first edition of Phillis Wheatley&rsquo;s book of poems. This collection also maintains the personal libraries of artists/scholars/ filmmakers Camille Billops and James V. Hatch.</p>
                            <p>The library focuses on six principal collecting areas:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Civil rights and post-civil rights movements</li>
                                <li>Black print culture </li>
                                <li>African American literature and the arts</li>
                                <li>Expatriate literary and cultural figures</li>
                                <li>Religion</li>
                                <li>African Americans and sports</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Such collections make Emory&rsquo;s holdings distinctive and attractive to scholars and students seeking rare and unique materials. From the many gifts of the Camille Billops-James V. Hatch archive to the papers of Charles and Ruth Wood, African American collections are a growing, popular, innovative, and vital pillar in the Rose Library.</p>

                            <p>The Rose Library&rsquo;s <a href="http://rose.library.emory.edu/collections/modern-politics/index.html">modern political</a> and <a href="http://rose.library.emory.edu/collections/southern-history.html">historical collections</a> document the history, culture, and politics of Atlanta, Georgia, and the South. That story emerges from distinctive primary source materials, including firsthand accounts of the 1864 fall of Atlanta; the fight to pass the Equal Rights Amendment in Georgia; the civil rights movement; the struggle to desegregate schools; the influence of politicians, business leaders, philanthropists, and journalists; and the history, culture, politics, and public health initiatives of the LGBT community. Highlights include:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Papers of United States Senator Sam Nunn</li>
                                <li>Records of the Atlanta Contemporary Art Center</li>

                            <p>These collections explore Atlanta&rsquo;s transformation from a town of 89,000 people in 1900 to a regional metropolis of more than 6 million residents in 2010. Together the materials tell the story of the region&rsquo;s move from the margins to the forefront of American life.</p>

These materials enhance the library&rsquo;s teaching and research mission by making records about Emory&rsquo;s history and development available to students, faculty, staff, alumni, and the public. The archives support university advancement by providing a permanent repository for records of administrative value.</p>
                            <p>The archives also feature the papers of faculty and administrators who are influential in the history of the university.

                        <section>
                            <h4>Research</h4>

                        <h3>Exhibitions, Programming, and Partnerships</h3>
                        <p>Outreach activities connect visitors who are not conducting research or attending a class in Rose, but may be engaged through an exhibition, special program or other activities. The Rose Library offers K-12 programs, tours, exhibits and public programming to share and connect with the campus, local, and research communities.</p>
                        <p>A thriving <a href="http://web.library.emory.edu/exhibitions/index.html">exhibitions program</a> helps promote the Rose Library&rsquo;s holdings within its own spaces and in the prominent Schatten Gallery, where major offerings, such as the current Beat poetry-related &ldquo;<a href="http://web.library.emory.edu/news-events/news/archives/2017/beats-exhibition-emory.html">Dream Machine</a>&rdquo; exhibition, attract hundreds of visitors.</p>
                        <p>Last year the Rose Library showcased materials in 20 campus exhibitions and loaned materials for 11 exhibits at other institutions nationwide, including The Coca-Cola Company and the Brooklyn Museum. Programming for the Rose Library&rsquo;s recent exhibition, &ldquo;<a href="http://billops-hatch.library.emory.edu/">Still Raising Hell</a>,&rdquo; took place on and off campus to encourage new visitors and more dynamic engagement.</p>
                        <p>The Rose Library hosts a full roster of speakers, author readings and other public programs. Highlights including appearances by poet laureates Rita Dove, Juan Felipe Herrera and Natasha Trethewey, Nobel Prize-winner Seamus Heaney, noted novelists Salman Rushdie and Alice Walker, and former President Jimmy Carter.</p>
                        <p>Partnerships across the Emory campus and broader community have enabled the Rose Library to further extend its reach and connect with even broader audiences. A recent campus initiative with Emory&rsquo;s Carlos Museum resulted in a collaborative exhibition of one of Shakespeare&rsquo;s First Folios. Other notable collaborators include the AJC Decatur Book Festival, which has brought keynote speakers such as Civil Rights legend John Lewis and novelist Joyce Carol Oates to the Emory campus.</p>
